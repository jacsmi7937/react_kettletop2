Kettle Top BrewHouse - This is a company website that hase been implemented for the need to show users the menu and display the events that are advertised on a their social media pages.  This was started as an assignment for school that has turned into a small project to be preseneted to the customer to help them with marketing thier brand.  Although this is not a finished product the basic bones of the project have been created and will be updated over time.

Since you are reading this before you begin developing or viewing the website there is a basic navigation guide to run through the webpage.

Lets start with the navigation tabs.

Home -  This is the main page of the website that explains the main objectives of the business.  Since this is the home page it is important to show the user what exactly the business does.  As you can see it explains the events that are held every week for its customers.

Menu -  This is the page that inspired the project as thier was no easy way to see what all was on the menu or see what the weekly/daily specials were.

About us - This was important to help the user get an idea of the enviroment and how the business was established.  I felt this was important to offer a story for the user to make the business seem much more relatable to bring in more business.

Contact us - This page gives the experience that will direct you to their social media pages.  This page alos offers the contact information where they can be reached for all business iquiries. Finally I felt it was important to show the hours of opperation for the establishment.

Thank you for visiting my site.  Any feedback would be appreciated send all messaged to jacsmi7937@students.ecpi.edu
